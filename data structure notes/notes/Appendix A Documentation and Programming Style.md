#### Naming variables and classes
- use camel typing for naming variables "`numberOfTaxes"
#### comments
- Best programs are self-documenting
	- I.E: clean style, well chosen names that make its purpose and logic clear to any programmer who reads said program
	- for single line comments use "`//`" for block comments use "`/**`"
	- too many comments are as bad as few, every program file should begin with explanatory comment,
		- gives all the important infomation about the program file, what it does, what the assignment is.
		- EVERY method should begin with a comment that explains the method
		- EX: `double radius; // In inches
			 `double area; // In square inches`

#### objects and classes
- ==`Object oriented programming`==: class that specifies what action the object can take and how they can accomplish those actions
- ==`Object`==: program construct that contains data and can preform certain actions
- A ==Class== is like a blueprint for constructing specific objects or a general description of what that object is and what it can do
		- EX:![[Pasted image 20250912232341.png]]
- ==`Instance`==: another name for object, but usually calls to the mid the idea of classes
- a ==Class== is a type or kind of ==Object==, all objects in the same class have the same kinds of data and the same actions
- ==`Client`==: programs component that uses a class
- Tip: make each data field in a class private by beginning its declaration with the access modifier `private`
- ==`Members of object`==: data fields and methods of an object
