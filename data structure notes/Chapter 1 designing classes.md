## Encapsulation
- a design principle of OOP(object oriented programming)
- ==`Encapsulation`==: hides fine detail of what is inside a "Capsule"(also known as ==`information hiding`==)
- java code should be made so that details are hidden and necessary controls are visible
- Encapsulation encloses data and methods within a class, hides implementation details that arent necessary for using the class
- ==`Abstraction`== process that ask you to focus on what instead of how.
	- Abstraction ask you to focus on what data and operations are important.
- when designing a class you shouldnt worry about how the class's methods will work.
	- allows you to focus on fewer details, making task easier
